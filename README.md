# Baker Hughes Challenge: Object Detection in Advanced Manufacturing

# Introduction: 
The landscape of manufacturing is evolving rapidly and leading disruptive technology in the energy transition. As the technology matures, it is vital to better understand the processes and employ advanced analytics. In-situ process monitoring in additive manufacturers enables us to look into the build process of these parts to further enable the detection of anomalies that will impact part quality. The objective of this challange is to identify the objects on a build plate that helps to detect anomolies.

# Project Description:
The end goal is to develop a model that will be capable of detecting objects (in this case parts) on a typical build plate for a metal additive manufacturing modality. Starting simpler and getting familiar with object detection using a sample dataset. The dataset given comprised of images of flowers and the goal will be to identify the shape of either the whole flowers or parts of the flower on each image.

When dealing with images, it will be important to consider the appropriate preprocessing methods that will help your model to read the images, your choice in model for the object detection, and the appropriate tuning of hyperparameters inherent to your model.
